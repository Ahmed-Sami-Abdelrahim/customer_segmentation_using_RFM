# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using RFM 

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to segment customers based on their behavior using the RFM model — a widely used marketing technique for understanding customer value.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, such as:

- Loyal customers
- At-risk customers
- High spenders
- Recently active vs. inactive customers

By using EDA techniques, we extract meaningful insights from transactional data to support targeted marketing strategies.

## 📊 What is RFM?

RFM stands for:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase  
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends

These three metrics are calculated through EDA techniques and used to assign scores for each customer, allowing segmentation based on purchasing patterns.

🧩 Based on these RFM scores, customers are categorized into four key segments:

- 🥇 **Platinum** – Most valuable and active customers  
- 🥈 **Gold** – High-value customers with regular purchases  
- 🥉 **Silver** – Moderate purchasing activity and value  
- 🟫 **Bronze** – Least active or low-value customers

This segmentation allows businesses to tailor marketing efforts to each group more effectively.

## 🔍 Why EDA?

To derive accurate RFM scores, we performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** which includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and formatting issues  
- Visualizing distributions and trends  
- Extracting meaningful features from raw transaction data
