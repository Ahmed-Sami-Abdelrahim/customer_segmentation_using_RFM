# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, a proven marketing method that analyzes customer value and behavior. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on how recently, how often, and how much they purchase.

## ðŸ“Š What is RFM?

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer has made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends.

These metrics are used to segment customers into groups such as loyal customers, at-risk customers, and potential new customers.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
